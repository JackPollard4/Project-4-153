# Project-4-153
Our project focused on examining the historical context of nutrition and public health in Uganda before and after the implementation of the 2011 Food Fortification Regulations. By analyzing trends in micronutrient deficiencies—particularly in Vitamin A and Iron intake—we aimed to critically assess the effectiveness of existing interventions. This foundation allowed us to develop a well-informed, evidence-based alternative policy proposal designed to optimize nutrient delivery and address persistent gaps in Uganda’s current food fortification strategy.
