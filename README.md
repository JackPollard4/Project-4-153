## Goals
Our project focused on examining the historical context of nutrition and public health in Uganda before and after the implementation of the 2011 Food Fortification Regulations. By analyzing trends in micronutrient deficiencies—particularly in Vitamin A and Iron intake—we aimed to critically assess the effectiveness of existing interventions. This foundation allowed us to develop a well-informed, evidence-based alternative policy proposal designed to optimize nutrient delivery and address persistent gaps in Uganda’s current food fortification strategy.

- Design a targeted subsidy-tax policy to improve Vitamin A intake in Uganda using economic incentives.
- Evaluate the policy’s fiscal impact by comparing government subsidy costs to projected tax revenue.
- Develop a clear presentation and codebase to communicate your findings and support your policy recommendations.

## File Descriptions
Mary2009-10.ipynb
Benchmark analysis using pre-policy data. Serves as the baseline to evaluate nutrition and expenditure before Uganda’s 2011 food fortification regulation.

Jack 2015-16.ipynb
Follow-up analysis using post-policy data. Used to assess the effectiveness of Uganda’s 2011  mandate by comparing changes in nutrient adequacy over time.

Calcium Lump Sum Policy.ipynb
Proposed policy 2. Proposes a targeted lump-sum cash transfer to improve calcium adequacy in the most deficient region. Includes adequacy distribution analysis, Engel curves, and cost comparisons across transfer sizes.

VitaminA Subsidy Policy.ipynb
Proposed policy 1 - simulation focused on subsidizing vitamin A–rich foods.  Models a combined subsidy–tax policy aimed at improving Vitamin A intake.
